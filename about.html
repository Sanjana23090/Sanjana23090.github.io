    <h2 style="color: purple;">About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>HI, MY NAME IS <i>Sanjana</i></strong></p>
    <p>And <strong>Flavour Fusion</strong> is my little corner of the internet! <br>
    I'm the voice, author and creator behind Flavour Fusion. What started as a casual hobby of reading blogs while I was studying in school has now made me create this blog today. I am an undergrad student who is passionate
     about exploring new technologies along with some fun recipes that can help millions of people over the internet. So I thought why don't I just put both of my interests together in this particular blog. This whole blog is 
    developed by me using basic HTML. </p>
    <p>I live in India. As a teenager, I was curious about different cuisines available around the world. Being a foodie for all of my life, I want to share some of my local recipes to those who love to experiment with new dishes.</p>
    <h3>I LOVE FOOD</h3>
    <p>In this space, I will be sharing fresh, flavorful and mostly healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual undergrad life. Freshman stress is not a joke.
        So to bust those overwhelming mood swings, these recipes provides you with immense pleasure. My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable and exciting.</p>
    <p>On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing the food that you're making. It will make my day if you tag me in your Instagram photos and stories!
    </p>
    <p>Along with these recipes, I will also share bits and pieces of my life outside "the foodie" world.
        From my university stories to my personal favourites and mostly on mental health. This blog is not gonna be boring at all. 
        It will be funny and interesting.. 
    </p>
